# Day 3 — Error Handling & Reliability

Focus:
- Option and Result types
- Error propagation (`?`)
- Custom error types
- Panic vs recoverable errors

Code demonstrates:
- Handling missing values
- File IO with Result
- Custom application errors
- Safe error propagation
- Controlled crashes

Goal:
Learn how to design reliable and debuggable Rust systems.
