# Day 9 — Priority-Based Job Scheduling

Focus:
- Priority queue using BinaryHeap
- Custom Ord, PartialOrd, Eq implementations
- Scheduling logic in thread pools
- Heap-based task execution

Code demonstrates:
- Custom Job struct with priority field
- BinaryHeap as a max-heap scheduler
- Manual trait implementations for ordering
- Priority-based execution of tasks

Goal:
Introduce scheduling logic into the thread pool to support priority-based job execution.
