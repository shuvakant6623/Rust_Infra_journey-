# Day 2 — Lifetimes & Advanced Borrowing

Focus:
- Reference lifetimes
- Lifetime annotations (`'a`)
- Borrow checker rules
- Scope-based validity

Code demonstrates:
- Safe vs unsafe references
- Functions with explicit lifetimes
- Structs holding references
- Methods with lifetime parameters
- Nested scope safety

Goal:
Build intuition for how Rust ensures reference safety at compile time.
