# Day 8 — Thread Pool with Result Handling

Focus:
- Returning values from concurrent jobs
- Per-task response channels
- Request–response pattern
- Generic task execution

Code demonstrates:
- Generic result-returning tasks
- mpsc channels for responses
- Worker execution with result propagation

Goal:
Extend thread pool into a more practical concurrent task execution engine.
